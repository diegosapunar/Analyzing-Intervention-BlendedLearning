## Abstract
Higher education institutions are increasingly considering the use of a form of blended learning, commonly named as Flipped Classroom, in which students watch video lectures drawn from a Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) before a face-to-face lecture. This methodology is attractive since it allows institutions to reuse high-quality material developed for MOOCs, while increasing learning flexibility and the students’ autonomy. Implementing such a methodology however faces a number of challenges, the most salient being the lack of student self-regulatory skills, which may result in frustration and low performance. In this paper, we study how a self-regulatory learning technological scaffold, which provides students with feedback about their activity in the MOOC, affects the engagement and performance of students in a MOOC-based flipped classroom. To this end we design an observational study in which 242 students participated, where 133 students in the experimental group (EG) use a technological scaffold and the remaining 109 in the control group (CG) do not. We did not find statistically significant difference between the grades of the two groups. However, the EG exhibited a statistically significant greater engagement with the course and a more accurate strategic planning than the CG. Discussion on the main implications for scaffolding SRL in FC derived from these results are discussed.
